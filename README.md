# Example

This is an example configuration made in order to illustrate a support request on [grunt-usemin](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin).

## Reproducing steps

Run the following:

```sh

$ npm install
$ grunt
```

This should open a connect server in port ```8080```, so if you head to ```http://localhost:8080/``` you should see some network errors in the developer tools (at least in Chrome).
